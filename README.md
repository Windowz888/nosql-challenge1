# nosql-challenge1
This project involves an analysis of food hygiene rating data from the UK Food Standards Agency. The purpose of this analysis is to help the food magazine, "Eat Safe, Love", evaluate the ratings data and guide their future articles and recommendations.

Getting Started

To get started, create a new repository for this project named nosql-challenge. Ensure that this project is not added to any existing repository. Clone the new repository to your computer. Add the provided Jupyter notebook starter files and your Resources folder containing establishments.json to this repository. Finally, push these changes to GitHub.

Files Needed

The files needed for this challenge include NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb, NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb, and establishments.json. The establishments.json file contains the data we will be analyzing, and the two Jupyter notebooks contain starter code for the challenge.

Instructions

The challenge is divided into three parts.

Part 1: Database and Jupyter Notebook Set Up involves importing the establishments.json file into a new MongoDB database and confirming that the data has been imported correctly.

Part 2: Update the Database requires several modifications to the database, such as adding a new restaurant and updating various fields.

Part 3: Exploratory Analysis involves answering several questions about the data, including:

1) Which establishments have a hygiene score equal to 20?
2) Which establishments in London have a RatingValue greater than or equal to 4?
3) What are the top 5 establishments with a RatingValue of 5, sorted by lowest hygiene score, nearest to the new restaurant added, "Penang Flavours"?
4) How many establishments in each Local Authority area have a hygiene score of 0?
